 * \brief Definitions for NVSHMEM initialization/finalize class.
 * gmxNvshmemHandle takes the MPI communicator and initializes the
 * NVSHMEM over all the ranks involved in the given MPI communicator.
 * This is a collective call for all the ranks in the given MPI comm.
 * After NVSHMEM initialization all NVSHMEM APIs can be safely used.
