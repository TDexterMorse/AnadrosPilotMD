The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.397 nm between atom 45 and 48

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
