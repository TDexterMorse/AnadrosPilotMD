Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.200 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.200 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
