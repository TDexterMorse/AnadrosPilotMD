Working dir:  /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1/build/tests/complex/nbnxn_rzero
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -notunepme

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 4 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Can not increase nstlist because an NVE ensemble is used
On host ip-172-31-60-115 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:1,PP:2,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 8 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'dipoles'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 20.2%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 18%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 3.6%.


NOTE: 1 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      23 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

NOTE: 38 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options

Thanx for Using GROMACS - Have a Nice Day
