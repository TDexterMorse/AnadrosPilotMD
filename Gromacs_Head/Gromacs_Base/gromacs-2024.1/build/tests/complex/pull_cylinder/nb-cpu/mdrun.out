NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 24 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 0.947 to 1.075

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints
