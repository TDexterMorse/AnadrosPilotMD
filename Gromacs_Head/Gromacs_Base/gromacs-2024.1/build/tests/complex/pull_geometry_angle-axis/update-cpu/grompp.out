Excluding 3 bonded neighbours molecule type 'ALANINEDIPEPTIDE'

turning H bonds into constraints...

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.393 nm between atom 9 and 19

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 310 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.802 nm, buffer size 0.002 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.800 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 24x24x24, spacing 0.119 0.119 0.119

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.91

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
