Executable:   /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1/build/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1 (source tree)
Working dir:  /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1/build/tests/complex/nbnxn-energy-groups
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -nb cpu -notunepme

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)
Multiple energy groups is not implemented for GPUs, falling back to the CPU. For better performance, run on the GPU without energy groups and then do gmx mdrun -rerun option on the trajectory with an energy group .tpr file.

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 24 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 80, rlist from 0.9 to 0.992


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 24 MPI threads
Using 2 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'water+hexane'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 6 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
