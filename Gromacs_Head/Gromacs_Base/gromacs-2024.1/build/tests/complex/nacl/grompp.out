Analysing residue names:
There are:   576        Ion residues

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.000 nm between atom 0 and 0

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 1200 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.011 nm, buffer size 0.011 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 24x24x24, spacing 0.188 0.188 0.188

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.78

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
