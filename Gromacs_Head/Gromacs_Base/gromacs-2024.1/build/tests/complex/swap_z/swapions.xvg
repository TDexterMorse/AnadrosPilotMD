# Split0 group 'Ch0' contains 83 atoms.
# Split1 group 'Ch1' contains 83 atoms.
# Solvent group 'SOL' contains 11931 atoms with 3 atoms in each molecule of charge 0.
# Ion group 'NA+' contains 19 atoms with 1 atom in each molecule of charge 1.
# Ion group 'CL-' contains 19 atoms with 1 atom in each molecule of charge -1.
#
# Initial positions of split groups:
# Split0 group Z-center 7.291843 nm
# Split1 group Z-center 2.376072 nm
#
# Split0 cylinder radius 0.900000 nm, up 0.750000 nm, down 0.750000 nm
# Split1 cylinder radius 0.900000 nm, up 0.750000 nm, down 0.750000 nm
#
# Coupling constant (number of swap attempt steps to average over): 1  (translates to 0.004000 ps).
# Threshold is 1.000000
#
# Remarks about which atoms passed which channel use global atoms numbers starting at one.
# Requested charge imbalance is Q(A)-Q(B) = 0 e.
