Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 50, rlist from 1.014 to 1.143

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

GPU direct communication can not be activated because:
  Swap-coords is not supported.

On host ip-172-31-60-115 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 8 GPU tasks in the 8 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:1,PP:1,PP:2,PP:2,PP:3,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 8 MPI threads
Using 6 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

SWAP: Determining initial numbers of ions per compartment.
SWAP: Setting pointers for checkpoint writing
SWAP: Channel 0 flux history for ion type NA+ (charge 1): 0 molecules
SWAP: Channel 1 flux history for ion type NA+ (charge 1): 0 molecules
SWAP: Channel 0 flux history for ion type CL- (charge -1): 0 molecules
SWAP: Channel 1 flux history for ion type CL- (charge -1): 0 molecules
starting mdrun 'Channel_coco in octane membrane'
2 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 175.5%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 3%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 5.4%.

NOTE: 5.4 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      Dynamic load balancing was automatically disabled, but it might be beneficial to manually turn it on (option -dlb yes.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.

NOTE: 1 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      12 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

NOTE: 31 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
