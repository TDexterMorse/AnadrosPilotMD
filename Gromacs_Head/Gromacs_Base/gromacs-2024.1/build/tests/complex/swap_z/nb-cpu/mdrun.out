Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

GPU direct communication can not be activated because:
  Swap-coords is not supported.

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 35.7%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 7%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.5%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.838
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 1.5 %
