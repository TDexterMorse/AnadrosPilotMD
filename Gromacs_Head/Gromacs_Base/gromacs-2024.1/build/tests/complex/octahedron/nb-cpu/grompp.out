The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.205 nm between atom 4972 and 4974

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.001 kJ/mol/ps at 298 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.433 nm, buffer size 0.033 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.401 nm, buffer size 0.001 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 36x36x36, spacing 0.143 0.143 0.143

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.22

This run will generate roughly 1 Mb of data
