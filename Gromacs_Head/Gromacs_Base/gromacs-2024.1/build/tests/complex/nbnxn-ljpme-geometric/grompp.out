The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.406 nm between atom 1382 and 1385

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.006 nm, buffer size 0.006 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 52x28x28, spacing 0.116 0.108 0.108

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.63

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
