Command line:
  gmx mdrun -notunepme

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 4 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.029

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

On host ip-172-31-60-115 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:1,PP:2,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 8 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'water+hexane'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 2 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      28 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

Thanx for Using GROMACS - Have a Nice Day
