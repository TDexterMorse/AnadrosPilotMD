The largest distance between non-perturbed excluded atoms is 0.164 nm between atom 1503 and 1504

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.903 nm, buffer size 0.003 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.900 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Using a fourier grid of 20x20x20, spacing 0.123 0.123 0.123

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.42

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
