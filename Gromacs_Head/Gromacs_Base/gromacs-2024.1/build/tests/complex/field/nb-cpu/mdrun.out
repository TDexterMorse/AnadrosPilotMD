Command line:
  gmx mdrun -notunepme -nb cpu

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 6 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Can not increase nstlist because an NVE ensemble is used
Using 6 MPI threads
Using 8 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Water'
10 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 15.7%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 21%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 3.3%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 %


NOTE: 44 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
