Generated 330891 of the 330891 1-4 parameter combinations

Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'SOL'

Cleaning up constraints and constant bonded interactions with virtual sites
Analysing residue names:
There are:   216      Water residues

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.152 nm between atom 418 and 419

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.910 nm, buffer size 0.010 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.900 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 16x16x16, spacing 0.117 0.117 0.117

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.22

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
