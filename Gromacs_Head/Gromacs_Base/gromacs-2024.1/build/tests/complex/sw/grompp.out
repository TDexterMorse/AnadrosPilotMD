Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'SW'

turning all bonds into constraints...

Cleaning up constraints and constant bonded interactions with virtual sites
Analysing residue names:
There are:   216      Other residues

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.164 nm between atom 682 and 683

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298.15 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.840 nm, buffer size 0.040 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.804 nm, buffer size 0.004 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Using a fourier grid of 32x32x32, spacing 0.058 0.058 0.058

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.40

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
