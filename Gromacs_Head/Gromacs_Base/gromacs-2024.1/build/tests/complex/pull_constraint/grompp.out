Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'SOL'

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298.15 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.896 nm, buffer size 0.096 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.871 nm, buffer size 0.071 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
