Working dir:  /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1/build/tests/complex/pull_constraint
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -notunepme

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 4 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

On host ip-172-31-60-115 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:1,PP:2,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 8 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Water'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 81.9%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 9%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 7.4%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 %

NOTE: 7.4 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.

NOTE: 0 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      11 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
