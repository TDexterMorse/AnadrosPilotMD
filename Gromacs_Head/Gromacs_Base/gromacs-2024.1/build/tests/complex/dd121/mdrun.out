Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)
Can not increase nstlist because verlet-buffer-tolerance is not set or used
Update groups can not be used for this system because an incompatible virtual site type is used

On host ip-172-31-60-115 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 12 GPU tasks in the 12 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:1,PP:1,PP:1,PP:2,PP:2,PP:2,PP:3,PP:3,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 12 MPI threads
Using 4 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Protein'
20 steps,      0.1 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 30.7%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 5%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.7%.


NOTE: 1 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      60 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
