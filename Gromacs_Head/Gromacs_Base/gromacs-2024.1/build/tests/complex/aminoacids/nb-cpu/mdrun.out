Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 10 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 5.034 to 5.286

Using 10 MPI threads
Using 4 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Protein'
10 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 72 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
