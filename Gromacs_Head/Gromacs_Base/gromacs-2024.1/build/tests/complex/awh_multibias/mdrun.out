Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 4 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 80, rlist from 1.004 to 1.229

On host ip-172-31-60-115 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:1,PP:2,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 8 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Alanine-dipeptide'
50 steps,      0.1 ps (continuing from step 20,      0.0 ps).

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 14 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

NOTE: 49 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
