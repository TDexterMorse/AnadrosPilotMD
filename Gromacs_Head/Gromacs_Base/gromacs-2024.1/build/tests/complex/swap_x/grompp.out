The center of mass of the position restraint coord's is  4.844  2.186  2.095

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.403 nm between atom 184 and 187

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.082 nm, buffer size 0.082 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.014 nm, buffer size 0.014 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 72x32x32, spacing 0.134 0.135 0.135

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.26

This run will generate roughly 3 Mb of data
