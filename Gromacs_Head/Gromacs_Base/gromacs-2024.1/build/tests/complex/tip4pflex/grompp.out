Generated 6 of the 6 1-4 parameter combinations

Excluding 1 bonded neighbours molecule type 'SOL'

Cleaning up constraints and constant bonded interactions with virtual sites
Analysing residue names:
There are:   768      Water residues

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.175 nm between atom 2842 and 2843

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 252.517 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.902 nm, buffer size 0.002 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.900 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 24x28x25, spacing 0.112 0.111 0.117

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.22

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
