Working dir:  /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1/build/tests/complex/tip4pflex/nb-cpu
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -notunepme -nb cpu

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 24 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Can not increase nstlist because an NVE ensemble is used
Update groups can not be used for this system because atoms that are (in)directly constrained together are interdispersed with other atoms

Using 24 MPI threads
Using 2 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun '512 TIP/4P Flexible'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 13.2%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 36%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 4.8%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.881
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 1.4 %


NOTE: 46 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
