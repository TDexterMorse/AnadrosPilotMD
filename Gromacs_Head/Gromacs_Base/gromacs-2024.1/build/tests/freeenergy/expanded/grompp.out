The largest distance between non-perturbed excluded atoms is 0.152 nm between atom 2025 and 2026

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.003 nm, buffer size 0.003 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 32x32x32, spacing 0.094 0.094 0.094

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.61

This run will generate roughly 1 Mb of data
