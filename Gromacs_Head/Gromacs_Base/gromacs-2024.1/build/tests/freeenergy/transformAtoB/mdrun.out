Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 4 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 50, rlist from 0.903 to 1.043

On host ip-172-31-60-115 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:1,PP:2,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 8 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Tryptophan Side Chain Analog'
60 steps,      0.1 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 2.6%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 38%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.0%.
