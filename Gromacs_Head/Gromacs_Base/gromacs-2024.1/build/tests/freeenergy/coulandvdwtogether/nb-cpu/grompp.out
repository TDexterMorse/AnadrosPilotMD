The largest distance between non-perturbed excluded atoms is 0.165 nm between atom 863 and 864

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 303.115 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Using a fourier grid of 24x24x18, spacing 0.126 0.126 0.168

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.37

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
