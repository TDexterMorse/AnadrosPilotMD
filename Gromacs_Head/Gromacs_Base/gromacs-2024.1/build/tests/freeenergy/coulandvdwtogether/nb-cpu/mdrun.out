Executable:   /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1/build/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1 (source tree)
Working dir:  /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1/build/tests/freeenergy/coulandvdwtogether/nb-cpu
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -notunepme -nb cpu

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 20 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Can not increase nstlist because an NVE ensemble is used
Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 20 MPI threads
Using 2 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'AA'
40 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 13.3%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 43%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 5.7%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.779
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 5.5 %

NOTE: 5.7 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
NOTE: 5.5 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
