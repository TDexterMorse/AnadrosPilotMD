The largest distance between non-perturbed excluded atoms is 0.152 nm between atom 2437 and 2438

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.900 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.900 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 36x36x36, spacing 0.091 0.091 0.091

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.65

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
