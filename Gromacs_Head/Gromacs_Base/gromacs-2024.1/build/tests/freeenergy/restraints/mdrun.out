Working dir:  /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1/build/tests/freeenergy/restraints
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -notunepme

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 5 to 100, rlist from 0.9 to 0.9

On host ip-172-31-60-115 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 8 GPU tasks in the 8 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:1,PP:1,PP:2,PP:2,PP:3,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 8 MPI threads
Using 6 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Protein in water'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 0 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      12 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
