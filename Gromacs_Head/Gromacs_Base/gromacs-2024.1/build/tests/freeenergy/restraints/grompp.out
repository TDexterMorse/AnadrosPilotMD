The largest distance between non-perturbed excluded atoms is 0.431 nm between atom 1608 and 1616

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.900 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.900 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 72x72x72, spacing 0.093 0.093 0.093

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.34

This run will generate roughly 4 Mb of data
