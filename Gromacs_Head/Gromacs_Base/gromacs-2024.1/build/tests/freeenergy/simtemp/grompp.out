The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.186 nm between atom 4 and 5

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.750 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.750 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 32x32x32, spacing 0.094 0.094 0.094

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.60

This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
