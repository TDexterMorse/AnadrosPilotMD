Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 4 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 25 to 100, rlist from 1.05 to 1.171

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

On host ip-172-31-60-115 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:1,PP:2,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 8 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

ED: Initializing essential dynamics constraints.

ED: Found 1 ED group.
ED: Flooding 2 eigenvectors.
ED: Initial RMSD from reference after fit = 0.254147 nm
ED: Setting center of flooding potential (0 = average structure)
ED: A (possibly changing) ref. projection will define the flooding potential center.

NOTE: DLB will not turn on during the first phase of PME tuning
starting mdrun 'GUANYLIN (A-FORM) (ENDOGENOUS LIGAND TO THE HEAT STABLE in water'
0 steps,      0.0 ps.

NOTE: 7 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      77 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

Thanx for Using GROMACS - Have a Nice Day

ED: EV 1 flooding potential center:  5.0000e-01 (adding  0.0000e+00/timestep)
