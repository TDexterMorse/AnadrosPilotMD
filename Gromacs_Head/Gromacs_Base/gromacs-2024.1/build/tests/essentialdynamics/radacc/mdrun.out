Executable:   /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1/build/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1 (source tree)
Working dir:  /home/ubuntu/W4GROMACSPIPE/Gromacs_Head/Gromacs_Base/gromacs-2024.1/build/tests/essentialdynamics/radacc
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -ei sam.edi -eo radacc.xvg

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2024.1 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 4 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 2 to 2

On host ip-172-31-60-115 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:1,PP:2,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 8 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

ED: Initializing essential dynamics constraints.
ED: Reading edi file sam.edi
ED: Note: Reference and average structure are composed of the same atom indices.
ED: Found 1 ED group.
ED: Initial RMSD from reference after fit = 0.000000 nm
starting mdrun 'DRG-radacc'
50 steps,      0.1 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 0 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      18 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
