This test checks that LJ-PME with geometric combination rules behaves correctly
with the Verlet cut-off scheme. The test-system is the same as in nbnxn_pme,
a united atom hexane slab with water. It should also test for correct use and
implementation of DispCorr = EnerPres with LJ-PME, but the magnitude of the
correction for this system is tiny.
