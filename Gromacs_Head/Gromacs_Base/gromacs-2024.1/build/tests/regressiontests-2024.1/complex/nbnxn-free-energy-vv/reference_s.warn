WARNING 1 [file /Users/hess/regressiontests/complex/nbnxn-free-energy-vv/grompp.mdp, line 327]:
  You are using soft-core interactions while the Van der Waals interactions
  are not decoupled (note that the sc-coul option is only active when using
  lambda states). Although this will not lead to errors, you will need much
  more sampling than without soft-core interactions. Consider using
  sc-alpha=0.

WARNING 2 [file /Users/hess/regressiontests/complex/nbnxn-free-energy-vv/grompp.mdp]:
  The Berendsen barostat does not generate any strictly correct ensemble,
  and should not be used for new production simulations (in our opinion).
  We recommend using the C-rescale barostat instead.

WARNING 3 [file topol.top, line 48]:
  Some parameters for bonded interaction involving perturbed atoms are
  specified explicitly in state A, but not B - copying A to B

WARNING 4 [file topol.top, line 145]:
  The GROMOS force fields have been parametrized with a physically
  incorrect multiple-time-stepping scheme for a twin-range cut-off. When
  used with a single-range cut-off (or a correct Trotter
  multiple-time-stepping scheme), physical properties, such as the density,
  might differ from the intended values. Since there are researchers
  actively working on validating GROMOS with modern integrators we have not
  yet removed the GROMOS force fields, but you should be aware of these
  issues and check if molecules in your system are affected before
  proceeding. Further information is available at
  https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs/-/issues/2884, and a longer
  explanation of our decision to remove physically incorrect algorithms can
  be found at https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.11474583.v1 .
