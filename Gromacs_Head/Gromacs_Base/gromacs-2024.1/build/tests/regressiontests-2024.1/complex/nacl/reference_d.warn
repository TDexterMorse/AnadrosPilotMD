WARNING 1 [file /Users/hess/regressiontests/complex/nacl/grompp.mdp]:
  The Berendsen thermostat does not generate the correct kinetic energy
  distribution, and should not be used for new production simulations (in
  our opinion). We would recommend the V-rescale thermostat.

WARNING 2 [file /Users/hess/regressiontests/complex/nacl/grompp.mdp]:
  The Berendsen barostat does not generate any strictly correct ensemble,
  and should not be used for new production simulations (in our opinion).
  We recommend using the C-rescale barostat instead.

WARNING 3 [file /Users/hess/regressiontests/complex/nacl/grompp.mdp]:
  For proper integration of the Berendsen thermostat, tau-t (0.1) should be
  at least 5 times larger than nsttcouple*dt (0.025)
