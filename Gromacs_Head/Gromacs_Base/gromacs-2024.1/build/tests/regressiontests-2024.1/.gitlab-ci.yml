# CI is organized into stages so that if early stages fail
# the later ones are not run.
stages:
  # Preparation of GROMACS source
  - pre-build
  # Configuration for building and testing
  - configure-build
  # Build GROMACS in multiple configurations
  - build
  # Unit test each configuration, perhaps in multiple ways
  - test

include:
  # Mix-in helper job definitions of general utility.
  - local: '/admin/gitlab-ci/global.gitlab-ci.yml'
  - local: '/admin/gitlab-ci/rules.gitlab-ci.yml'
  # Build and test GROMACS in a variety of environments and configurations.
  # To do: Consider expanding matrix here to improve transparency and reduce file sizes.
  # E.g. '/admin/gitlab-ci/matrix/clang-8.gitlab-ci.yml
  - local: '/admin/gitlab-ci/gromacs.matrix.gitlab-ci.yml'
  # Prepare release archives.
  - local: '/admin/gitlab-ci/archive.gitlab-ci.yml'
