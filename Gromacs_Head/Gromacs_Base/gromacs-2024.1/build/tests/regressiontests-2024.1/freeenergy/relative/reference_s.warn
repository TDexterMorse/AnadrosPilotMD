WARNING 1 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  The switching range should be 5% or less (currently 5.56% using a
  switching range of 0.850000-0.900000) for accurate electrostatic
  energies, energy conservation will be good regardless, since ewald_rtol =
  1e-06.

WARNING 2 [file ./grompp.mdp]:
  You are not using center of mass motion removal (mdp option comm-mode),
  numerical rounding errors can lead to build up of kinetic energy of the
  center of mass
