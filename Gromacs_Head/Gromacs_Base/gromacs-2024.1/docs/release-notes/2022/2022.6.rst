Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix CUDA PME spread in multi-GPU runs (with >=3 GPUs)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Due to incorrect indexing of the second grid, spread could give incorrect
with when separate PME ranks are used and pipelining is enabled.
Runs with >=3 GPUs with direct GPU communication enabled
(``GMX_ENABLE_DIRECT_GPU_COMM`` env. var.) are affected.

:issue:`4732`


Fix missing synchronization in GPU PME pipelining
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A missing synchronization could have caused incorrect long-range PME electrostatics
forces/energies to be produced when GPU PME pipelining was used.

Only runs with >=3 GPUs and with direct GPU communication enabled 
(``GMX_ENABLE_DIRECT_GPU_COMM`` env. var.) are affected.

:issue:`4734`
