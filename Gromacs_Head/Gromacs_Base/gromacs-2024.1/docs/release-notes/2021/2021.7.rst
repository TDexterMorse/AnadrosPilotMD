Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add missing net charge term when running PME on a GPU
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When PME was running on a GPU, the term due to a net charge of the system was missing.
In normal runs this only changed the potential energy by a constant, which is usually
not relevant. In free-energy calculations where the net charge of the systen changes,
the would lead to incorrect dV/dlambda and Delta lambda values (but one should anyhow
avoid changing the net charge of a system with free-energy calculations).
