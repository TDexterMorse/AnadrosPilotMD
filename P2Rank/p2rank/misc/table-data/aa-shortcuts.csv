ALA	A	Alanine		hydrophobic
CYS	C	Cysteine		free amino group makes it basic and hydrophilic
ASP	D	Aspartic acid		"carbohydrate can be covalently linked (""N-linked) to its -NH"
GLU	E	Glutamic acid		free carboxyl group makes it acidic and hydrophilic
PHE	F	Phenylalanine		oxidation of their sulfhydryl (-SH) groups link 2 Cys (S-S)
GLY	G	Glycine		free carboxyl group makes it acidic and hydrophilic
HIS	H	Histidine		moderately hydrophilic
ILE	I	Isoleucine		so small it is amphiphilic (can exist in any surroundings)
LYS	K	Lysine		basic and hydrophilic
LEU	L	Leucine		hydrophobic
MET	M	Methionine		hydrophobic
ASN	N	Asparagine		strongly basic and hydrophilic
PRO	P	Proline		hydrophobic
GLN	Q	Glutamine		very hydrophobic
ARG	R	Arginine		causes kinks in the chain
SER	S	Serine		"carbohydrate can be covalently linked (""O-linked"") to its -OH"
THR	T	Threonine		"carbohydrate can be covalently linked (""O-linked"") to its -OH"
VAL	V	Valine		scarce in most plant proteins
TRP	W	Tryptophan		a phosphate or sulfate group can be covalently attached to its -OH
TYR	Y	Tyrosine		hydrophobic
